# test-cmis.sh - end-to-end proof that the CMIS connector plugin ingests from a real repository (#125).
#
# Ingests from the running Alfresco's own CMIS endpoint, the only real CMIS 1.1 server this stack already
# has, and the place where the two things unit tests cannot show are visible: that the browser binding
# works against a live repository, and that a document restricted in the source is not retrievable by a
# user its ACL excludes.
#
# Opt-in, and deliberately not a phase of run-tests.sh, for the same reasons as test-connector.sh:
# the 'connector' profile is opt-in, and wiring it into every run would make the whole suite depend on
# a Maven build of a project outside the reactor.
#
# What this suite deliberately does NOT do. Each of these cost minutes per run and proved something that
# was already proved elsewhere, which is how a useful suite turns into an expensive one:
#
#   - It does not rebuild the connector jar when one is already built. The jar is a build artefact, and
#     rebuilding it (installing content-lake-spi into a container-local repository first) spends two to
#     four minutes re-deriving what `mvn package` produced. Pass BUILD_JAR=true to force it.
#   - It does not run the native Alfresco adapter over the same folder to compare document sets. That is
#     a second full ingest, embeddings included, to learn a number the Alfresco REST API answers in one
#     call: how many documents the folder holds. test-alfresco.sh already covers the native path.
#   - It does not wait for the repository (AFTS) index. Only the native adapter's discovery queries it;
#     CMIS traversal reads the folder directly, so that wait bought nothing here.
#   - It does not poll for minutes. The permission filter picks up a new source within its 30-second
#     discovery window, so a document that is not retrievable inside a minute will not become so.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - the alfresco (or full/demo) base stack already up and healthy
#   - the AI backend on :12434, since ingestion embeds
#   - Docker, curl, jq, unzip
#   - a built jar under ../content-lake-app/plugins/cmis-connector/target/, or BUILD_JAR=true
#
# Usage:
#   CONNECTOR_SYNC_USERNAME=admin CONNECTOR_SYNC_PASSWORD=admin \
#   RAG_AUTH=admin:admin ./test/test-cmis.sh
#
# Environment variables:
#   CONNECTOR_SYNC_USERNAME / CONNECTOR_SYNC_PASSWORD  Sync API credentials (required, no defaults)
#   ALF_AUTH        Alfresco credentials, user:password (default: admin:admin)
#   RAG_AUTH        Credentials for the RAG service (default: admin:admin)
#   HOST            Target host (default: localhost)
#   USE_HTTPS       "true" to use https and pass -k to curl (default: true, as the proxy redirects)
#   APP_SOURCE      Path to the content-lake-app checkout (default: ../content-lake-app)
#   BUILD_JAR       "true" to build the connector jar even when one exists (default: false)
#   POLL_DEADLINE_S Seconds to wait for a document to become retrievable (default: 60)
#   KEEP_RUNNING    "true" to leave the service, the jar and the fixtures in place (default: false)

# What is asserted is that the second pass did not re-embed. Two mechanisms reach that and which one
# fires is a property of the source, not of this host: since #147 a connector's modifiedAt is stored, so
# a source whose timestamp round-trips exactly is caught by the metadata staleness check and never
# reaches extraction, while one whose timestamp is absent or coarser reaches extraction and is caught by
# the content fingerprint. CMIS reports millisecond precision and takes the first path. Asserting the
# short circuit specifically failed this suite for taking the cheaper route.
