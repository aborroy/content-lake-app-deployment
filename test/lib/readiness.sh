# readiness.sh - shared readiness probes for the end-to-end harnesses.
#
# Sourced by run-tests.sh and run-phase1.sh so the two cannot drift apart on what "ready" means. They
# did drift, and it cost an hour per run: run-tests.sh waited for HTTP 200 on /api/rag/health while
# run-phase1.sh waited for the payload's status to be UP. That endpoint answers
# `200 {"status":"DOWN"}` while its dependencies are still starting (see SemanticSearchController.health),
# so the 200 check returned immediately and the Alfresco suite began against a service that was not
# serving. The B-series then failed on documents the ingester had never discovered, which reads as a
# code regression and is not one. See aborroy/content-lake-app-deployment#20.

# Callers must have CURL_TLS set ("-k" when the proxy terminates TLS with a self-signed certificate).
