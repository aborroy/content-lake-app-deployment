# test-connector.sh - end-to-end proof that a connector jar can ingest (#132).
#
# Builds the sample connector from ../content-lake-app/plugins/examples, drops the jar into
# ./connectors, starts plugin-batch-ingester on top of an already-running base stack, triggers a sync
# and asserts the fixture documents are retrievable through the RAG service.
#
# Opt-in, and deliberately not a phase of run-tests.sh: the 'connector' profile is opt-in like
# 'filesystem', and wiring it into every run would make the whole suite depend on a Maven build of an
# example project.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - a base stack already up and healthy (make up-alfresco / up-nuxeo / up-full / up-demo)
#   - the AI backend on :12434, since ingestion embeds
#   - Docker, curl, jq
#   - an index holding no documents for this connector's source type. The fixtures mount at a fixed
#     container path, so every run writes the same node ids while RUN_TAG changes, and a previous run's
#     documents sit under the ids this run is about to write. Retrieval then matches the stale text and
#     T14-T16 and T19 fail for that reason alone, with ingestion passing throughout. Run `make clean`
#     first, per the standing rule that a leftover index pollutes results. T0 below checks this rather
#     than leaving it to be rediscovered four failed assertions later.
#
# Usage:
#   CONNECTOR_SYNC_USERNAME=admin CONNECTOR_SYNC_PASSWORD=admin \
#   RAG_AUTH=admin:admin ./test/test-connector.sh
#
# Environment variables:
#   CONNECTOR_SYNC_USERNAME / CONNECTOR_SYNC_PASSWORD  Sync API credentials (required, no defaults)
#   RAG_AUTH        Credentials for the RAG service, user:password (default: admin:admin)
#   HOST            Target host (default: localhost)
#   USE_HTTPS       "true" to use https and pass -k to curl (default: false)
#   APP_SOURCE      Path to the content-lake-app checkout (default: ../content-lake-app). Also becomes
#                   CONTENT_LAKE_GIT_CONTEXT, so the image is built from that checkout rather than from
#                   the GitHub default pinned in .env
#   POLL_DEADLINE_S Seconds to wait for a document to become retrievable (default: 60)
#   BASE_PROFILE    Base profile activated alongside 'connector', needed because the service declares
#                   depends_on hxpr-app (default: alfresco)
#   BUILD_JAR       "true" to rebuild the connector jar even when one exists (default: false)
#   KEEP_RUNNING    "true" to leave the service and the jar in place afterwards (default: false)
