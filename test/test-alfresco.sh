MEMORANDUM

To:   All Staff
From: Human Resources Department
Re:   Updated Remote Work Policy — Effective Immediately

This memorandum outlines the revised remote work eligibility criteria applicable to all
permanent employees. Following extensive consultation with department heads, the following
framework has been approved by the executive committee.

Eligibility and Days Permitted
Employees with a minimum of six months of continuous service are eligible to work from home
up to three days per week. Requests must be submitted to and approved by the direct line
manager at least two working days in advance. Approval is at the manager's discretion based
on workload and team requirements.

Home Office Equipment Allowance
The company will provide a one-time home office equipment allowance of five hundred pounds
to cover ergonomic chair, desk accessories, and broadband upgrade costs. Claims must be
submitted with receipts within ninety days of the policy taking effect. The allowance does
not cover monitors or computing equipment, which remain the company's property and must be
collected from the IT department.

Connectivity and Security Requirements
Employees working remotely must use the company VPN at all times. Personal devices are not
permitted for processing confidential data; only company-issued laptops may be used. Any
security incidents must be reported to the IT helpdesk within one hour of discovery.

Performance and Availability Expectations
Remote working employees are expected to maintain the same productivity baseline as in-office
days. Core hours of nine to three must be observed, during which employees must be reachable
by phone, Teams, or email within fifteen minutes. Failure to meet availability requirements
may result in remote work privileges being suspended.

Welfare and Wellbeing
The wellbeing team offers bi-monthly virtual check-ins for remote workers. Employees are
encouraged to take regular breaks and to maintain a clear boundary between work and personal
time. The occupational health team can provide ergonomic assessments on request.

For questions about remote work eligibility please contact HR at hr@company.internal.

INFORMATION SECURITY POLICY — VERSION 3.2

1. PURPOSE AND SCOPE
This Information Security Policy establishes the minimum requirements for protecting company
data, systems, and infrastructure. It applies to all employees, contractors, and third parties
who access company systems. Compliance is mandatory. Violations may result in disciplinary
action up to and including termination.

2. ACCESS CONTROL REQUIREMENTS
Access to systems and data is granted on the principle of least privilege. User accounts must
be provisioned through the Identity Management System. Shared accounts are strictly prohibited.
Access rights must be reviewed quarterly by system owners. Dormant accounts inactive for sixty
days are automatically disabled.

3. PASSWORD COMPLEXITY REQUIREMENTS
All passwords must be at least fourteen characters long and contain a mix of uppercase,
lowercase, digits, and special characters. Passwords must not contain the user's name,
username, or commonly used sequences. Passwords expire every ninety days. Reuse of the last
twelve passwords is blocked. Multi-factor authentication is mandatory for all privileged
accounts and remote access.

4. DATA CLASSIFICATION SCHEME
Data is classified into four tiers: Public, Internal, Confidential, and Restricted.
Confidential data must be encrypted at rest using AES-256 and in transit using TLS 1.3.
Restricted data may not leave the corporate perimeter without explicit CISO approval.
Personally identifiable information is classified as Confidential by default.

5. INCIDENT RESPONSE
Security incidents must be reported to the Security Operations Centre within one hour of
discovery. The incident response team will triage, contain, and remediate the incident
according to the documented runbook. Post-incident reviews are mandatory for all P1 incidents.
Forensic evidence must be preserved and chain of custody maintained.

6. VULNERABILITY MANAGEMENT
All systems must be patched within fourteen days of a critical CVE publication. Penetration
tests are conducted annually by an approved third party. Internal vulnerability scans run
weekly. Findings are tracked in the vulnerability management platform and reviewed by the
security team at monthly cadence.

PRODUCT ROADMAP — FISCAL YEAR 2025–2026

STRATEGIC THEMES

The product strategy for the next eighteen months is organised around three pillars:
AI-first experiences, mobile-first design, and an open API platform. Each pillar has a
dedicated workstream with quarterly delivery milestones tracked in the programme board.

Q1 2025: FOUNDATIONS
The Q1 delivery focuses on infrastructure modernisation. The monolithic API gateway will be
decomposed into domain-specific microservices. The new API platform will expose stable v2
endpoints with OpenAPI 3.1 specifications and a developer portal with interactive playground.
AI feature integration begins with an embedded suggestion engine that surfaces related content
as users type.

Q2 2025: MOBILE FIRST STRATEGY
The mobile-first redesign of the core application will ship in Q2. The new React Native client
replaces the legacy hybrid app. Key user journeys have been reworked with a thumb-friendly
navigation model. Offline mode supports the ten most frequently accessed content types.
Push notification infrastructure is upgraded to support rich media and deep-linking.

Q3 2025: AI FEATURE RELEASE
Q3 delivers the semantic search and RAG-powered assistant across all clients. Users can ask
natural language questions and receive grounded answers with source citations. The assistant
is context-aware and maintains a per-session conversation history. The initial model is
hosted on-premise; a cloud model routing option is planned for Q4.

Q4 2025: PLATFORM OPENNESS
Developers will be able to build extensions using the published SDK in Q4. A marketplace for
certified integrations launches alongside enhanced webhook support covering all major content
lifecycle events. Enterprise customers receive dedicated support SLAs for API consumers.

2026 OUTLOOK
The 2026 roadmap features expanded language support (twelve additional locales), a no-code
automation builder, and a cross-platform desktop client. Feedback from the partner advisory
board will be incorporated into the detailed Q-plan in October 2025.

REST API SPECIFICATION v2.0 — CONTENT LAKE SERVICE

1. OVERVIEW
The Content Lake REST API provides programmatic access to document ingestion, search, and
retrieval capabilities. All endpoints accept and return JSON. The base URL is
https://api.content-lake.internal/v2. Authentication uses Bearer tokens issued by the IDP
at /connect/token using the client_credentials grant.

2. AUTHENTICATION
POST /connect/token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=<id>&client_secret=<secret>&scope=content-lake

The response includes access_token (JWT), token_type=Bearer, and expires_in (seconds).
Include the token as Authorization: Bearer <token> on all API requests. Tokens expire after
3600 seconds. The client must refresh before expiry to avoid 401 responses.

3. DOCUMENT ENDPOINTS

GET /documents
Lists all documents visible to the authenticated principal. Supports pagination via
limit (default 20, max 100) and cursor query parameters. Filters: source_type, created_after,
mime_type. Returns a paginated list with next_cursor if more results exist.

POST /documents
Ingests a new document. Multipart body: metadata (JSON part) and content (binary part).
Metadata must include source_id, node_id, and mime_type. Returns 202 Accepted with a
job_id for tracking ingestion progress.

GET /documents/{id}
Returns the full document record including sys_acl, embeddings count, and ingest properties.
Returns 404 if the document does not exist or the caller lacks read access.

DELETE /documents/{id}
Removes the document and all associated embeddings. Returns 204 on success. Returns 403 if
the caller is not the document owner or an admin.

4. SEARCH ENDPOINTS

POST /search/semantic
JSON body: { "query": string, "top_k": int, "min_score": float, "filters": object }
Returns a ranked list of matching document chunks with source metadata. The min_score
parameter controls the relevance threshold (range 0.0–1.0). HTTP authentication token
identity is used for ACL filtering.

POST /search/hybrid
Combines vector similarity (kNN) with BM25 full-text search using reciprocal rank fusion.
Body is identical to semantic search. Use when exact keyword matches are important alongside
semantic relevance. JSON schema validation is applied to the request body.

5. ERROR HANDLING
All errors return a JSON body: { "error": string, "code": int, "request_id": string }.
Rate limiting returns 429 with Retry-After header. Malformed requests return 400 with a
validation detail array. Server errors return 500 with a support reference number.

ANNUAL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE REPORT
FISCAL YEAR 2024
Prepared by: Group Finance | Approved by: Board of Directors

SECTION 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The fiscal year 2024 delivered outstanding results. Total consolidated revenue reached
two point four billion pounds, representing year-on-year growth of fifteen percent.
Adjusted EBITDA improved to four hundred and eighty million pounds, a margin of twenty
percent. Net profit after tax was two hundred and ten million pounds, up from one hundred
and seventy million in fiscal year 2023. The board has approved a final dividend of twelve
pence per ordinary share, bringing the full-year distribution to twenty pence per share.
Free cash flow generation was strong at three hundred and forty million pounds.

SECTION 2: REVENUE ANALYSIS BY DIVISION

The Group operates four reporting divisions: Enterprise Software, Professional Services,
Managed Cloud, and Licensing. Enterprise Software remained the largest contributor,
generating nine hundred and sixty million pounds in the year, representing growth of
eighteen percent driven by new logo acquisition and strong renewal rates above ninety-two
percent. Professional Services revenue grew eleven percent to five hundred and forty
million pounds. Managed Cloud was the fastest growing division at thirty-one percent,
reaching four hundred and twenty million pounds. Licensing revenue declined five percent
to four hundred and eighty million as customers transitioned to subscription models,
consistent with the strategy communicated to shareholders at the Capital Markets Day.

SECTION 3: GROSS PROFIT AND MARGIN

Group gross profit was one point zero zero eight billion pounds, representing a gross
margin of forty-two percent, up from thirty-nine percent in the prior year. The margin
improvement reflects continued mix shift toward higher-margin cloud and software revenue,
partially offset by investment in professional services headcount to support growth.
Enterprise Software gross margin reached seventy-one percent. Managed Cloud gross margin
expanded by four percentage points to sixty-three percent as infrastructure unit costs
declined and utilisation rates improved.

SECTION 4: OPERATING EXPENSES

Research and development expenditure was two hundred and sixteen million pounds,
representing nine percent of revenue, in line with the board's commitment to invest a
minimum of eight to ten percent of revenue in product innovation. Sales and marketing
costs were three hundred and twelve million pounds, reflecting targeted investment in
demand generation in North America and the Asia-Pacific region. General and administrative
costs were held flat year-on-year at one hundred and forty-four million pounds despite
inflationary pressures, demonstrating effective cost discipline across central functions.

SECTION 5: EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EARNINGS

Reported EBITDA was four hundred and thirty-two million pounds. Adjusted EBITDA, excluding
share-based compensation charges of twenty-four million pounds, restructuring costs of
eighteen million pounds, and acquisition-related amortisation of six million pounds, was
four hundred and eighty million pounds. The adjusted EBITDA margin of twenty percent
represents the highest level achieved in the Group's history and reflects sustained
operational leverage as the business scales.

SECTION 6: CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AND FREE CASH FLOW

Capital expenditure for the year was sixty million pounds, comprising forty-two million
of investment in cloud infrastructure and eighteen million in facilities and equipment.
Capitalised development costs were ninety-six million pounds. Working capital improved
by thirty-six million pounds as a result of faster customer collections and extended
supplier payment terms negotiated during the year. Free cash flow conversion from
adjusted EBITDA was seventy-one percent, ahead of the sixty-five percent medium-term
target communicated at the Capital Markets Day in March 2023.

SECTION 7: NET DEBT AND BALANCE SHEET

Net debt at year end was one hundred and eighty million pounds, representing a leverage
ratio of zero point four times adjusted EBITDA, well within the board's two times
covenant. The revolving credit facility of three hundred and fifty million pounds was
undrawn. Total equity attributable to shareholders was one point two billion pounds.
Goodwill and intangible assets arising from acquisitions totalled eight hundred and
forty million pounds. The Group's capital allocation framework prioritises organic
investment first, followed by bolt-on acquisitions, then returns to shareholders through
dividends and buybacks.

SECTION 8: ACQUISITIONS AND INTEGRATION

During fiscal year 2024 the Group completed two bolt-on acquisitions. Datasync Limited was
acquired in July 2023 for an enterprise value of seventy-two million pounds and has been
fully integrated into the Enterprise Software division. Analytix Partners was acquired in
January 2024 for an enterprise value of one hundred and eight million pounds; integration
of the technology and go-to-market teams is proceeding to plan and is expected to complete
in the first half of fiscal year 2025. The combined contribution from acquisitions to
revenue in fiscal year 2024 was forty-eight million pounds.

SECTION 9: GEOGRAPHIC PERFORMANCE

The United Kingdom and Ireland remained the largest region, contributing nine hundred
million pounds in revenue, with growth of nine percent. North America was the fastest
growing region, delivering revenue of five hundred and forty million pounds, growth of
twenty-four percent, underpinned by strong new logo momentum and the Datasync acquisition.
Continental Europe contributed four hundred and eighty million pounds, growth of twelve
percent. Asia-Pacific and Rest of World contributed three hundred and sixty million pounds,
growth of twenty percent, reflecting early-stage market penetration investments.

SECTION 10: PEOPLE AND CULTURE

The Group ended the fiscal year with five thousand and four hundred full-time equivalent
employees, an increase of six hundred from the prior year. Employee engagement scores
remained above eighty percent in the annual survey. The voluntary attrition rate was
eleven percent, below the sector average of fourteen percent. The Group invested sixteen
million pounds in learning and development programmes. Female representation in senior
leadership roles increased from thirty-one to thirty-five percent.

SECTION 11: ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE

The Group reduced absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions by eighteen
percent year-on-year, ahead of the twenty percent five-year target set in the 2021
sustainability report. Renewable energy accounted for seventy-eight percent of total
electricity consumption across owned premises. The Group published its first TCFD-aligned
climate risk disclosure in October 2023. Supplier sustainability assessments were conducted
for the top two hundred suppliers by spend, representing eighty-five percent of total
procurement expenditure.

SECTION 12: OUTLOOK AND GUIDANCE

The Board is confident in the Group's ability to deliver continued profitable growth in
fiscal year 2025. The Group has strong forward visibility supported by a twelve-month
committed revenue backlog of one point eight billion pounds at the fiscal year end.
Revenue guidance for fiscal year 2025 is two point six to two point seven billion pounds,
representing growth of eight to thirteen percent. Adjusted EBITDA margin guidance is
maintained at twenty to twenty-one percent.

SECTION 13: PRINCIPAL RISKS

The principal risks identified by the Board include macroeconomic uncertainty affecting
customer spending, cybersecurity threats to systems and customer data, talent retention in
a competitive labour market, technology disruption from artificial intelligence, and
regulatory change including data protection and AI governance frameworks. Each risk is
managed through a dedicated mitigation programme overseen by the Audit and Risk Committee.

SECTION 14: CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

The Board comprises ten directors: four executive directors and six independent non-executive
directors. The Chair is independent. Board gender diversity is forty percent female.
Audit, Remuneration, and Nomination Committees met the recommended frequency. The Annual
General Meeting will be held on the fifteenth of June 2025 at the Group's registered office
in London.

SECTION 15: AUDIT CERTIFICATION AND REGULATORY COMPLIANCE FRAMEWORK

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted International
Accounting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. The independent
auditors, FinanceAudit LLP, have issued an unqualified opinion. The internal audit function
conducted forty-two reviews during the year and reported no material control deficiencies.
The Group is fully compliant with the UK Corporate Governance Code. All regulatory filings
were submitted within required deadlines. The compliance framework is subject to annual
independent review by external legal counsel.
