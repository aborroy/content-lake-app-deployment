#!/usr/bin/env bash
# test-sharepoint.sh - end-to-end proof that the SharePoint connector plugin ingests through Microsoft
# Graph, against the mock Graph service rather than a tenant.
#
# The mock is the target because a tenant is not merely inconvenient to obtain: registering an application
# is disabled in this tenant, and a SharePoint site a developer is only a member of returns a truncated
# ACL, so it cannot validate permission mapping at all. What runs here is the whole connector: real Graph
# protocol handling, real paging, real ACL mapping, real content downloads. Exactly two things differ from
# the cloud, the Graph base URL and the token provider, and both are configuration.
#
# Three passes over the same fixture tree: a walk, an incremental one through the change feed, and a third
# in hierarchical permissions mode under a second source id. The third is what measures the resource-unit
# cost of the two permission modes against each other rather than estimating it, and it finishes by
# reconfiguring the mock to honour no Prefer header at all, which the connector has to refuse rather than
# silently pay the per-item price for.
#
# What this cannot prove, and what still needs a tenant: real payload fidelity beyond the fixtures, app-only
# token acquisition (msal4j refuses an authority that is not https, so this run uses a static token),
# genuine throttling behaviour, and whether SharePoint itself honours the Prefer headers. The mock's
# willingness to honour one is configuration here and an administrator's grant of Sites.FullControl.All
# there.
#
# Opt-in, and deliberately not a phase of run-tests.sh, for the same reasons as test-cmis.sh: the
# connector profile is opt-in, and wiring it into every run would make the whole suite depend on a Maven
# build of a project outside the reactor.
#
# What this suite deliberately does NOT do:
#
#   - It does not rebuild the connector jar when one is already built. Pass BUILD_JAR=true to force it.
#   - It does not create fixtures. They are baked into the mock image, which is the point of the mock:
#     the grant shapes that matter are hard to construct in a real tenant and trivial to state as files.
#   - It does not poll for minutes to conclude an absence. Once a presence assertion has proved retrieval
#     works, "still not there" needs no deadline of its own.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - the alfresco (or full/demo) base stack already up and healthy, for hxpr and the RAG service
#   - the AI backend on :12434, since ingestion embeds
#   - Docker, curl, jq, unzip
#   - a built jar under ../content-lake-app/plugins/sharepoint-connector/target/, or BUILD_JAR=true
#
# Usage:
#   CONNECTOR_SYNC_USERNAME=admin CONNECTOR_SYNC_PASSWORD=admin \
#   RAG_AUTH=admin:admin ./test/test-sharepoint.sh
#
# Environment variables:
#   CONNECTOR_SYNC_USERNAME / CONNECTOR_SYNC_PASSWORD  Sync API credentials (required, no defaults)
#   RAG_AUTH        Credentials for the RAG service (default: admin:admin)
#   HOST            Target host (default: localhost)
#   USE_HTTPS       "true" to use https and pass -k to curl (default: true, as the proxy redirects)
#   APP_SOURCE      Path to the content-lake-app checkout (default: ../content-lake-app)
#   BUILD_JAR       "true" to build the connector jar even when one exists (default: false)
#   POLL_DEADLINE_S Seconds to wait for a document to become retrievable (default: 60)
#   KEEP_RUNNING    "true" to leave the services and the jar in place (default: false)
